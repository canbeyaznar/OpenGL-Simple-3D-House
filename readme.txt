Simple 3D House with OpenGL

This file describes how to run the OpenGL application located in the folder.
The application was written on the Windows operating system and CodeBlocks was used as the IDE.

Here are the steps I followed to write an OpenGL program:

1- "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pak-Z6uQjAQ" I downloaded CodeBlocks by watching this video and
I downloaded the necessary OpenGL libraries and installed them.

2- Then I created a new GLUT project in CodeBlock IDE and wrote the program.


HOW TO RUN?

Option 1: 161044038_HW1\home_hw1 in the sent folder if CodeBlocks is installed
There is a home_hw1.cbp file in the folder. Open this file and download it via CodeBlocks
Build the code (build & run button) and run it.

Option 2: If you are using a different IDE (e.g. visual studio), Only main.cpp
You can run it the way you want using the code in the file.
